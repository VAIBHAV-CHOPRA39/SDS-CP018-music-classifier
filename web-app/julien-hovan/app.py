    st.markdown("""
        This application uses deep learning to analyze audio files and predict their musical genre.
        The model has been trained on the GTZAN dataset, featuring 1000 audio tracks across 10 genres.
        
        **Supported Genres:**
        - Blues 🎸
        - Classical 🎻
        - Country 🤠
        - Disco 🕺
        - Hip Hop 🎤
        - Jazz 🎷
        - Metal 🤘
        - Pop 🎵
        - Reggae 🎼
        - Rock 🎸
        
        ---
        
        ### Model Architecture
        
        This project employs a sophisticated deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
        with multi-head attention mechanisms, achieving 85% accuracy on the test dataset.
        
        **The model processes audio in three main stages:**
        
        1. **Spatial Feature Extraction (CNN)**
           - Converts audio into spectrogram images
           - Processes 4-second segments through convolutional layers
           - Uses TimeDistributed layers to maintain sequential structure
        
        2. **Temporal Feature Extraction (Multi-Head Attention)**
           - Analyzes relationships between different time segments
           - Identifies key moments in the audio
           - Weighs the importance of different parts of the song
        
        3. **Genre Classification**
           - Processes the attention-weighted features
           - Makes final genre prediction through fully connected layers
        
        **Technical Details:**
        - Input: Spectrogram segments (4 seconds each)
        - Architecture: CNN + Multi-Head Attention
        - Performance: 85% accuracy on test set
        - Dataset: GTZAN (1000 tracks, 10 genres)
